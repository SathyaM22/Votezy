# Votezy

Votez is an voting app. This app enables or shifts the system of voting in
offline to a compatible mobile app with the help of internet. Similar to the
offline voting method the authentication process here ensures that the
user is valid person within the organization or any form of body.
Admin has the privileges and ensures that which user can register with
the app by sending them a unique id through which they can register and
enter the required further details to authenticate that he/she is a valid
citizen and they belong to such organization.
Admin will be able to initiate the voting process by mentioning the time
and the candidates who are taking part. The users will be able to join at a
specified time mentioned by the admin and vote will be casted once after
the user is authenticated while logging in to voting. The voting process
will automatically end when the time is up which will be mentioned by
the admin while starting the process.
At the end , the system counts all the votes casted and gives the result
along with a brief report of the voting process. Eventually, the report is
only generated to admin and he/she can show it to the users if needed.
The tools required to build the app are Android Studio, Firebase,
Tensorflow along with other required APIâ€™s.(Some of the tools mentioned
above are subject to change depending on the course of building the app
along with the compatibility).
